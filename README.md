Notes
I first looked at both images and the the main focus of the project. I then began working on step 1. Though i did make sure to look up grunt to ensure that my project could be run. I saw that a majority of the work was front-end changes but required resources I didnt have. I used photoshop to get the RGB codes to match each color scheme. I also went to the packback homepage to get the proper fonts for the page. Then I tried to match each area of the page and make it responsive, so that it worked for mobile use. Even though it was two pages I treid to oraganize the page as restful as i could. I created a user resource for the form page, that had the same attributes as the form on the screen shot. For working with svgs I found the only discrepancy in the color code, and used photoshop again to match the color.
