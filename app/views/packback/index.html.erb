	<p id="csbody">
	Jodi utilized Packback Answers in both of her courses this semester;
	Communication Theory and Introduction to Mass Communication.
	Both of these courses had approximately 150 students per class, and
	catered to the Freshman/Sophomore communication or general
	education student. Her goal in using Packback was to finally use a
	discussion board that cultivated quality discussion rather than just
	being busy work.	<%= image_tag "mascot.svg", alt:"Mascot image"%>

	“Packback completely changed the way my class interacted
	</p>
	<p class="blue-header">
	and engaged with the material. They became truly curious.”

	<strong class="mirror-author">Professor Smith:</strong>“Before Packback I wasn’t able
to effectively manage participation and
discussion in my lecture halls. It’s difficult tor
manage a meaningful discussion in a room with
100 people, and I knew there were a lot of kids
not participating. I knew they had important
contributions to make, too! I had tried
discussion boards on our LMS (Sakai) without a
great deal of success. Eventually, I just gave up.”

	<strong class="mirror-author">Professor Smith:</strong>“Packback has exceeded my
expectations in every way. It’s intuitive for the
students to use and it’s easy to peruse and
participate in discussions…[and] hasn’t added to
my workload, which I appreciate. What has
surprised me the most are the quality of the
questions the students are submitting. The
students ask questions that move far beyond
simple knowledge and comprehension of course.
